# collection-experiments

[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/palisades-lakes/multimethod-experiments.svg)](https://clojars.org/palisades-lakes/multimethod-experiments)

Benchmarks for collection implementations, as a form of
reproducible research.

One Clojure-specific question:
Can we identify when Clojure persistent collections are better,
and when simple immutable implementations 
(eg [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava))
perform better.
